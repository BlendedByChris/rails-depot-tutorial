          This book is a recipe-based approach to using Subversion that will
          get you up and running quickly---and correctly. All projects need
          version control: it's a foundational piece of any project' s
          infrastructure. Yet half of all project teams in the U.S. don't use
          any version control at all. Many others don't use it well, and end
          up experiencing time-consuming problems.
